# Default Training Configuration
# ================================================
# Everything needed by the Trainer class.
# Passed directly as the `cfg` dict — no nesting.
# ================================================

# --- Optimizer (AdamW) ---
lr: 1.0e-4                    # Learning rate
weight_decay: 0.05            # AdamW weight decay

# --- Training loop ---
epochs: 100                   # Total training epochs
max_grad_norm: 1.0            # Gradient clipping (0.0 = disabled)

# --- Learning-rate scheduler ---
warmup_epochs: 10             # Linear warmup epochs
scheduler_type: cosine        # Scheduler after warmup: "cosine"
min_lr: 1.0e-6               # Minimum LR at end of cosine schedule

# --- Checkpointing ---
ckpt_dir: ./checkpoints       # Directory for saving model checkpoints
save_every: 10                # Save checkpoint every N epochs

# --- Logging ---
log_dir: logs                 # TensorBoard / logger output directory
eval_every: 5                 # Run validation every N epochs (used when val_every_n_steps is null)
val_every_n_steps: 200       # Validate every N training steps (null = validate at end of epoch only)

# --- Reproducibility ---
